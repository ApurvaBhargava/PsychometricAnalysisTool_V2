I think I need a new computer.
Why?
Mine is so slow now. It takes a long time to start up and it keeps freezing.
That's not good. How old is it?
Several years old.
Yeah, it's probably time to replace it.
I don't know what to buy. There are so many different models these days.
You should go to a computer store and ask about the different kinds?
That's a good idea.
Indeed!
