Something's wrong with my computer.
Exactly what?
All I get is a black screen.
What's the matter?
I think I know, because this happened before.
What happened before?
My hard drive crashed.
Oh, no. That's bad news.
It sure is, but I'm going to call the services first, just to make sure.
Will you lose all your files?
No, I always back up my files.
You're smart.
