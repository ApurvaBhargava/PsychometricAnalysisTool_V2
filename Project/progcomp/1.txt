I need a new computer.
What's the matter with yours?
It's six years old.
That's pretty old.
It still works, but I am going to give it away.
Are you going to buy a desktop or laptop?
Oh, a laptop, of course.
A PC or a Mac?
I haven't decided that yet.
More and more people are using Macs.
But 90 percent of the world uses PCs. And that's not going to change anytime soon.
