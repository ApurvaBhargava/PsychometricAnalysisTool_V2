Well, computers are a great way to learn.
Yeah. Do you learn about computers on your own? 
I can surf the internet for that.

I have a PC. A Compac.
Do you like your computer or do you want a new one?
I want a new one cause I think I messed mine up and it's a little bit slow now.
OK. How long have you had your computer?
I've had it for about 3 or 4 years.
Oh, yeah, that's pretty old for a computer.
