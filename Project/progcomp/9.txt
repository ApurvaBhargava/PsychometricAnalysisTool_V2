Do you know anything about computers?
It depends. What's the matter?
My computer is running really slow. I don't know what's going on.
Have you tried to restart it?
Yeah. But it's still slow.
Do you think it was infected by a virus?
I don't think so. I scanned it for viruses.
I think you should have a professional take a look at it.
Yeah. Maybe it's time to get a new computer. This one is really old.
How old is it?
Ten years?
Ten years. I think that's the problem.
I think you're right. I guess it's time to buy a new one.
A new computer with better feature will work great.
