It sure is windy today.
Paper is flying everywhere.
This wind is dangerous for drivers.
Especially for drivers of big trucks.
The wind blows those trucks over.
It blows trees over, too.
A tree fell onto my dad's car.
Was there much damage?
My dad had to buy a new car.
Wow! That's terrible.
Never park your car under a tree.
The wind will get you, or the birds will get you.
