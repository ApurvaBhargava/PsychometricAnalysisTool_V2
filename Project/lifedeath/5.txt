What are you going to do about your death?
Well, mostly I'll try to avoid it.
I mean, are you going to get buried or cremated?
I would not die as humans do.
You're not going to be buried?
A coffin costs too much and takes up too much space.
Yes, but it will be in a cemetery where your children can visit you.
Children seldom visit their parents in a cemetery.
That's true. A cemetery is for dead people, not living people.
What about if you are cremated?
I will return to nature after being cremated.
