What's the point?
The point of what?
Of living.
Who knows? You live, and then you die.
We must be here for some reason.
Maybe we're here to have fun.
Then why aren't I having fun?
Because you're thinking too much.
So I should stop thinking?
Stop thinking about what the point is.
Okay. I'll start thinking about having some fun.
Just be patient. Fun doesn't come along every five minutes.
