How smart are you?
I don't know. I think I'm average.
Did you ever take an IQ test?
No, I never did. All I know is that I passed some tests.
What kind of tests?
Simple ones.
I wish I was really smart.
Don't be ridiculous.
What do you mean?
If you're going to make a wish, wish that you were really rich or famous.
Don't you ever wonder what it's like to be super smart?
It must be very lonely.
Why's that?
Because if you're super-smart, no one understands what you're saying.
