I'm so stressed right now.
Why?  Is there something wrong?
I'm so busy at work.  I'm forgetting about my personal life.
I understand.  That happened to me too.
How do you balance it all out?
I just set a strict schedule.  Work is work and home is home.
It's not that easy.
I know.  But if you don't do that, you're going to get sick.
I think that's my problem.  I feel sick all the time.
I hope you feel better soon.
