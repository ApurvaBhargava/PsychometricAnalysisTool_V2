Throw away those potato chips!
What's so bad about potato chips?
They'll rot your insides!
Oh, they're not so bad.
You should eat a different snack.
I think I'll have some frozen yogurt.
That is a much better snack!
I'd still like to eat potato chips though.
You had some yesterday.
I don't eat them very often.
You can have them later.
I guess that sounds pretty fair.
