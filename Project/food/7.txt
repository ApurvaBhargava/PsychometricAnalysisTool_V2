Continental breakfast every morning!
Wow! Do you think they serve pancakes?
Oh, with syrup and fresh fruit.
You can't forget the whipped cream!
And freshly brewed coffee!
I can't wait to see it all!
I think I'm more excited for breakfast than the trip.
Well, breakfast is the most important meal of the day.
That's very true.
