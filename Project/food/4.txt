How to make food?
It's super easy, just follow the box instructions.
We're all out of instant macaroni and cheese.
Well, make it from scratch, then.
How do I do that?!
Just cook the pasta, and mix it in cheese, milk, and butter.
It can't be that easy.
Cooking isn't hard at all. You can do it.
If I accidentally burn the house down, it's not my fault.
