Do you like bread?
Yes, I do.
OK. What kind of bread do you eat?
I try to eat whole grain bread or bagels or something that's dark. 
OK. What do you like to put on bread?
My favorite thing to put on bread is tomatoes and I also like honey.
OK. But not together?
Not together, no.
Do you like mustard?
No, I don't like mustard.
Oh, I love mustard. I eat mustard and bread just plain.
No, no. I know people that eat mustard sandwiches, and no!
OK. Can you make bread?
Yes, I can. Actually, I'm a baker.
Really.
Yeah!
Wow!
I'm a pastry chef.
That's incredible.
Although, bread is kind of a different branch. I do cakes and stuff like that.
