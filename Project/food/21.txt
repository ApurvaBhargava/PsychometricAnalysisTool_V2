What's your favorite cuisine?
I think I like American food. 
What type of American food? 
I like hamburgers. 
Hamburgers. Is that your favorite dish as well?
That is my favorite dish. My favorite hamburger place is right near where I went to university and they have this hamburger called the Danish Burger, and the Danish Burger has blue cheese inside the hamburger, so I love ... my favorite dish has to be the Danish Burger.
Do you like any side things like french fries with your hamburger?
I love french fries but I know that eating hamburger and french fries is a little bit unhealthy so I always replace the french fries for a salad.
A salad. OK. What about dessert? What's your favorite dessert?
My favorite dessert has to be chocolate cake.
Chocolate cake. Anything else? Do you like to eat it with anything? 
No, I like chocolate cake by itself. Anything else? I like brownie sundaes, like brownies and chocolate brownies with vanilla ice-cream. I guess my favorite dessert is anything chocolaty. 
Sounds good. So before you said you like to eat a salad. What type of salad, what type of vegetables do you like?
I like all vegetables. I like them cooked or raw but I don't like raw onions.
Not raw onions.
I really can't eat onions raw. That's probably the only vegetable I can't eat raw.
That's interesting. Thanks.
