Can I get you something to drink?
No, thanks. I just finished a whole bottle of water.
You won't mind if I have something then?
Of course not.
Can I offer you some fruit or cheese?
I just had lunch before I came here.
I really hope you don't mind if I eat because I haven't had lunch.
Go right ahead and do what you normally do.
I didn't eat because I assumed you would be joining me.
I hope you're not offended.
No, I'm not offended at all.
Oh, good. I ate before because I didn't want to impose.
