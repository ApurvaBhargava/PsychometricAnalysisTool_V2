What are we having for lunch?
I'm making some sandwiches.
Can I make some lemonade to drink?
Sure! That'd be great.
We just ate breakfast, but I'm already hungry.
Me too! It's amazing how hungry I get so soon!
I'm really looking forward to those sandwiches.
I just realized we're out of bread!
I guess lunch will have to be delayed.
Can you please go to the store and buy some?
Sure! Don't drink all the lemonade!
I won't! Come back soon. I'm starving!
