Why are you eating another apple?
You know what they say about apples!
No, I'm afraid I don't know.
An apple a day keeps the doctor away!
Especially if you throw it at him.
You should eat fruit; it's good for you.
I do eat fruit: just not as often as you do.
Eating healthy is wonderful!
I don't doubt it, but I still want pizza for lunch.
Only if you eat an apple, too.
Alright, I'll also eat an apple.
That's the spirit! You're healthier already.
