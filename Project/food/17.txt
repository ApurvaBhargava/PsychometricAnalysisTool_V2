What do you think I should get for dessert?
I don't know, look at the menu.
Wow! They have icecream, pies, cakes.
It looks like a great selection!
I don't know what to get!
It's kind of hot out. Maybe icecream would be good.
Icecream sounds fantastic!
How about we go to the icecream parlor down the street?
That sounds good to me! Let's go.
That pecan pie is calling my name, though.
Answer to icecream's call only!
You're right! Let's go!
