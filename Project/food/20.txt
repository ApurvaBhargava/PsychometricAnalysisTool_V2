Can you cut the vegetables, please?
How do you want me to cut them?
Cut the potatoes into big chunks.
What about the carrots?
Those you can cut in rounds.
Do I do the same to the celery?
No, you can cut that into strips.
There are so many ways to cut these things!
Yes, there really are!
Can I cut the zucchini into rounds?
That's what I was going to ask you to do.
Great! I'll get started now.
