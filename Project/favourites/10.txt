Hey, I saw that you're reading a book out there.
Yeah, that's right.
So, do you read a lot?
Yeah, I read a lot. In fact I don't watch television.
Ah, that is impressive.
Seriously, I only read.
Wow, how many books do you get through a week?
A week! Ah, at least one a week, because I work all the time.
Oh, that's pretty good.
Yeah, but I enjoy reading because television doesn't give you imagination, yeah I prefer reading.
Yeah, I hear you. It rots your mind, I think. Ah, also, what kind of books you like to read? What kind of genres?
Well, let's see, I've got a lot of nonfiction, a lot of comedy.
Cool, so actually, when you read, like where do you normally read?
Where do I normally read? On the trains, actually. I'm always reading on the trains. I read because I'm always traveling to work. A lot of pleasure. And it's funny because I meet people on the trains when I'm reading, they look over at my book.
That's cool. I love to read on the trains.
