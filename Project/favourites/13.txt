We're going to talk about destinations. 
I think I would enjoy travelling.
Where do you want to go?
I want to go to Thailand.
Thailand. Why Thailand?
Well, I love that country. The people, the food and the culture.
OK, and how would you get there?
Well, I guess from Narita Airport.
OK, how long would it take to get there?
Approximately 7 hours I would say.
7 hours, that's not too bad. What would you eat in Thailand?
I would eat Thai food which is something like Pat Thai, which is a Thai noodle, or Tom Yang Gung, which is a Thai soup.
OK, is it spicy?
It's spicy. 
Really. OK, how long would you stay?
As long as I can.
OK, Yeah. So.
As long as I don't get fired.
OK, Thailand has nice beaches and nice mountains. Which do you prefer the beaches or the moutains?
I prefer the beach.
The beach.
The beach. It's cold here. It's getting warm but I like warm weather.
OK, yeah, yeah. I miss the beach. I'm from California, we have nice beaches.
Oh, another beach person.
