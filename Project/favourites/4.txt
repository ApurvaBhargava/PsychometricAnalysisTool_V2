Poetry is wonderful.
I don't know anyone who does not like it.
Some of it is okay, I guess.
Yes, the poems that rhyme and are easy to remember.
Like One, two, buckle my shoe.
But people still write poems.
No one makes any money at it.
Shakespeare was a poet.
Did he get rich from his poetry?
Probably not.
Poems are a little bit like songs.
Yes, but songs have music. Without music, songs would not be so popular.
