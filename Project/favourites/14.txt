I'm going to talk about your favourites. 
Sure. No problem.
What's your favourite colour? 
I say, Black.
Black?
Yes.
OK. And what's your favourite fruit?
My favourite fruit is mango.
Why do you like mango?
It has a rich taste. It is really delicious.
What's your favourite season?
I'd say spring, cause it's a combination of warm weather, at the same time it's not hot like it is in the summer. In spring it's a bit cool. You can walk around very relaxed. It the best. It's a combination of all the seasons in one. 
OK. what's your favourite movie?
My favourite movie! I'd have to say Gladiator. Russel Crow. It's a tragic movie about a very strong leader who triumphs over very overpowering conflicts.
