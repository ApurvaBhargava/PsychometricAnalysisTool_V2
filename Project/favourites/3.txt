I don't get art.
Or artists.
They're in a different world.
I saw a painting of a jar that was full of pencils.
The artist said the jar was both full and empty.
But it was full of pencils! How could he say it was empty?
Artists see things differently.
Did you ever see anything that Picasso painted?
Of course! He's world famous.
Did he ever take art lessons?
I can't believe it. I drew paintings like that in third grade.
Where are they? Maybe they are worth millions.
