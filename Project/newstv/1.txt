Why do you seem so tired today?
I stayed up all night watching that new anime.
You stayed up to watch it again?
I just had to find out what happened next!
I don't think it's good to watch so many cartoons.
Anime series are not cartoons!
Of course, they are! They're drawn and colored.
Anime is not for children. The stories are more intense.
I think you're just telling yourself that.
Cartoons don't have storylines like anime series do.
Either way, it's just a silly television show.
You really don't understand the life of a fan.
