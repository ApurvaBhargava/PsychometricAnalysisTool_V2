TV news is so stupid.
They shouldn't even call it news.
Last night they told us about a cat in a sofa.
Yesterday they told us about a dog in a pipe.
Last week they told us about a bear in a back yard.
Last month they told us about a mouse in a restaurant.
The weatherman tells us the temperature in every town.
The sports guy shows us players fighting.
They always tell us what's next.
They always make what's next sound exciting, but it never is.
It's more like news for kids.
They should have kid reporters.
