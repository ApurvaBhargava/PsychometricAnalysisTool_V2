You're watching too much TV.
What do you mean?
I mean you're wasting your life.
I'm having fun.
You're sitting there with your mouth open.
Who cares?
I care. Do something.
Okay. I did something.
What did you do?
I turned up the volume.
That's not what I meant by "do something."
Will you do something? Leave me alone.
