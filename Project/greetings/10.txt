Gravity is very important.
What is gravity?
It's the force that pulls everything down.
I don't understand.
If you pour water into a glass, the water goes down into the glass.
Of course it does.
Without gravity, the water would go up.
You're joking.
Without gravity, you would go up.
What do you mean?
You would float into the sky like a balloon.
That would be fun!
