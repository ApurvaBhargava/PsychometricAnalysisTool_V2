Do you know any good jokes?
I can't remember jokes.
Neither can I.
They go in one ear and out the other.
Who makes up all these jokes?
Who knows? But there must be a hundred new ones every day.
Yes, just in English alone.
I wonder if every language has jokes.
Of course! People everywhere like good jokes.
What do you think people joke about the most?
I think most jokes are about women.
Oh, really? I did not think that was the case.
